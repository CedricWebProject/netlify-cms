## `Why creating Games?`

In 2015 I became interested in developing video games. I’ve always been interested into playing games of any genre but in this time I learned some programming skills, modelling 3D-Objects in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and putting it all together in [Unity](https://unity3d.com/de). Therefore I visited several workshops and worked myself through game development books for over two years.

In 2018 I visited a workshops called “Video Game Development” at the [Open Campus](https://opencampus.sh/) in Kiel. There I met a lot of people with the same ambitions like me and after a couple lessons I found a group which wanted to invent a game over a longer period of time. I joined them and we created our first little game together at a Game Jam of the Waterkant Festival in Kiel called “Mia Soul”.

## **`What is a Game Jam?`**

A Game Jam is an event where the goal is to invent a playable game in a given time period. If you're not that familiar with programming or working with game engine you can still join as a group and present the written game concept. Every Game Jam has a theme which the game should somehow be related to.

## **`Waterkant Festival 2018: Mia Soul`**

This is the result of my first Game Jam I participated in June 2018 at the [Waterkant Festival](https://waterkant.sh/) in Kiel. The Game Jam took 48 hours and on the last day of the festival all games were presented. The topic of the Jam was “The Secret Code”. 

We were five people in total, containing one programmer, one unity developer, two 3D artists and me. I was responsible for the sound design and the production of the game theme. Besides the main menu and credits I also invented the first concept of the level design.

At the beginning we gather ideas about what the game should be about. We had a few rounds where everyone presented an idea after a given time. We ended up combining two game mechanics: The narrative and the exploration.

There should be a female main character who is trapped in her own mind, waking up in front of a door sealed with a giant lock. Obviously she wants to get through this door.

Later during the Jam we found the name “Mia Soul” suiting well to our main character. So the player can explore the level with Mia by running and jumping. During exploration Mia can collect letters by simply walking through them. After all letters have been collected it is possible to decode these letters into a readable sentence by finding a secret code hidden in the level. This should unlock the door and release Mia into freedom.

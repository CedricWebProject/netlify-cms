This game is the result of a so called "GameJam" at the Waterkant Festival 2018. It was the first time I participated in a GameJam and it was a great experience.

## **`What is a GameJam?`**

A GameJam is an event where the target is to invent a playable game in a given time period. If you're not that familiar with programming or working with game engine you can still create a game concept and present it. Every GameJam has a theme which the game should somehow be related to.
